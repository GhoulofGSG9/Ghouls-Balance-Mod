# Ghouls Balance Mod

This mod contains various prototype balance changes based on various ideas of the NS2 balance team.

Current changes:

- Onos 
    - Boneshield doesn't heal armor anymore and instead grants a mucous shield of 400 hp while being used.

- Silence
    - Silence no longer affects any "non movement" sounds

- Mucous Cloud
    - Increased the mucous shield hp to 25% (from 15%) of the traget's hp
