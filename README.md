# Ghouls Balance Mod

This mod contains various prototype balance changes based on various ideas of the NS2 balance team.

Current changes:

- Onos 
    - Increased Onos cost to 62 personal resources
    - Boneshield doesn't heal armor anymore and instead grants a mucous shield of 400 hp while being used.

- Silence
    - Silence no longer affects any "non movement" sounds
    - Silence decreases the sound of alien movement for Spur 1 by 6 db, for Spur 2 by 10 db and for Spur 3 by 20 db (Before Spur 1: -3.5 db, Spur 2: -9.6 db and Spur 3: -∞ (absolutely silent))

- Mucous Cloud
    - Increased the mucous shield hp to 25% (from 15%) of the traget's hp

- Marine
    - Decreased the spread vector distance of the shotgun to 8.5 (from 10) to adjust the "death zone"² of it back to where it was before the alien hit box change.


²) The range in which you can kill Lerks and Skulks with one shot
