# Ghouls Balance Mod

This mod contains various prototype balance changes based on various ideas of the NS2 balance team.

Current changes:

- Onos 
    - Increased Onos cost to 62 personal resources
    - Boneshield doesn't heal armor anymore and instead grants a mucous shield of 400 hp while being used.

- Lerk
    - Increase non-celerity flap force to match celerity to reduce Lerk’s dependence on Celerity
    - Increased strafe flap force to help with spiking
    - Improved crouch diving mechanics to help with ambushing and spiking


- Silence
    - Silence no longer affects any "non movement" sounds

- Mucous Cloud
    - Increased the mucous shield hp to 25% (from 15%) of the traget's hp

- Marine
    - Decreased the spread vector distance of the shotgun to 8.5 (from 10) to adjust the "death zone"² of it back to where it was before the alien hit box change.


²) The range in which you can kill Lerks and Skulks with one shot
